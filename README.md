# Employee-Tracker

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This command-line application was built to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
